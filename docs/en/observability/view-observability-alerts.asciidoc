[[view-observability-alerts]]
= View and manage alerts

The Alerts page lists all the alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created using
one of the Observability apps.

After alerts have been triggered, you can monitor their activity to verify they are functioning correctly.
In addition, you can filter alerts and troubleshoot each alert in their respective app.

You can also add alerts to <<create-cases,Cases>> to open and track potential infrastructure issues.

NOTE: You can centrally manage rules from the
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{kib} Management UI] that provides a
set of built-in {kibana-ref}/rule-types.html[rule types] and
{kibana-ref}/action-types.html[connectors] for you to use. Click *Manage Rules*.

[[filter-observability-alerts]]
== Filter alerts

To help you get started with your analysis faster, use the KQL bar to create structured queries using
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language]. For example, `kibana.alert.rule.name : <>`.

You can use the time filter to define a specific date and time range. By default, this filter is set to search
for the last 15 minutes.

You can also filter by alert status using the buttons below the KQL bar.
By default, this filter is set to *Show all* alerts, but you can filter to show only active, recovered or untracked alerts.

[[view--alert-details]]
== View alert details

There are a few ways to inspect the details for a specific alert.

From the Alerts table, you can click the text in the *Reason* column to open the alert detail flyout to view a summary of the alert without leaving the page.
There you'll see the current status of the alert, its duration, and when it was last updated.
To help you determine what caused the alert, you can view the expected and actual threshold values, and the rule that produced the alert.

To further inspect the alert:

* From the alert detail flyout, click *Alert details*.
* From the Alerts table, click the image:images/icons/boxesHorizontal.svg[More actions] icon and select *View alert details*.

To further inspect the rule:

* From the alert detail flyout, click *View rule details*.
* From the Alerts table, click the image:images/icons/boxesHorizontal.svg[More actions] icon and select *View rule details*.

To view the alert in the app that triggered it:

* From the alert detail flyout, click *View in app*.
* From the Alerts table, click the image:images/icons/eye.svg[View in app] icon.

[[understand-alert-statuses]]
== Understand alert statuses

There are four common alert statuses:

`active`::
The conditions for the rule are met. If the rule has {kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-actions-details[actions], {kib} generates notifications based on the actions' notification settings. 

`flapping`::
The alert is switching repeatedly between active and recovered states. If the rule has actions that run when the alert status changes states, those actions are suppressed while the alert is flapping.

NOTE: Alert flapping is turned on by default. You can modify the criteria for changing an alert's status to the flapping state by configuring the **Alert flapping detection** settings. To do this, navigate to the **Alerts** page in the main menu, or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field]. Next, click **Manage Rules**, then **Settings** to open the global rule settings for the space. In the **Alert flapping detection** section, modify the rules' look back window and threshold for alert status changes. For example, you can specify that the alert must change its status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs for it to become a flapping alert. 

`recovered`::
The conditions for the rule are no longer met. If the rule has {kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-actions-details[recovery actions], {kib} generates notifications based on the actions' notification settings. Recovery actions only run if the rule's conditions aren't met during the current rule execution, but were in the previous one. 
+
An active alert changes to recovered if the conditions for the rule that generated it are no longer met. 
+
A flapping alert changes to recovered when the rule's conditions are unmet for a specific number of consecutive runs. This number is determined by the **Alert status change threshold** setting, which you can configure under the **Alert flapping detection** settings.
+    
For example, if the threshold requires an alert to change status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs to be considered flapping, then to recover, the rule's conditions must remain unmet for 6 consecutive runs. If the rule's conditions are met at any point during this recovery period, the count of consecutive unmet runs will reset, requiring the alert to remain unmet for an additional 6 consecutive runs to finally be reported as recovered.
+
Once a flapping alert is recovered, it cannot be changed to flapping again. Only new alerts with repeated status changes are candidates for the flapping status. 

`untracked`::
The rule is disabled, or you've marked the alert as untracked. To mark the alert as untracked, go to the **Alerts** table, click the image:images/icons/boxesHorizontal.svg[More actions] icon to expand the **More actions** menu, and click **Mark as untracked**. When an alert is marked as untracked, actions are no longer generated. You can choose to move active alerts to this state when you disable or delete rules.

[[customize-observability-alerts-table]]
== Customize the alerts table

Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the alerts table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Reorder the columns.
* **_x_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns.
* **Fields**: Select the fields to display in the table.

For example, click **Fields** and choose the `kibana.alert.maintenance_window_ids` field.
If an alert was affected by a {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html[maintenance window], its identifier appears in the new column:

[[cases-observability-alerts]]
== Add alerts to cases

From the Alerts table, you can add one or more alerts to a case. Click the image:images/icons/boxesHorizontal.svg[More actions] icon
to add the alert to a new or existing case.

NOTE: Each case can have a maximum of 1,000 alerts.

[[clean-up-alerts-obs]]
=== Clean up alerts

Manage the size of alert indices in your space by clearing out alerts that are older or infrequently accessed. You can do this by {kibana-ref}/view-alerts.html#clean-up-alerts[running an alert cleanup task], which deletes alerts according to the criteria that you define.
