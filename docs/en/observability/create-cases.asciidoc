= Cases

Collect and share information about observability issues by opening a case directly
in the Elastic {observability} app. Cases allow you to track key investigation details,
add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts,
comments, and visualizations. You can also send cases to third party systems by
<<cases-external-connectors,configuring external connectors>>.

You can also optionally add custom fields and case templates. preview:[]

NOTE: With the appropriate index access, you can <<visualize-case-data, build visualizations and metrics>> of data in {observability}, {stack-manage-app}, and {elastic-sec} cases. This can provide improved visibility into patterns and trends of cases within your space.

[[kibana-case-limitations]]
=== Limitations

* If you create cases in {observability}, they are not visible from the {security-app} or {stack-manage-app}. Likewise, the cases you create in {stack-manage-app} are not visible in the {observability} or {lastic-sec}. 
* You cannot attach alerts from {elastic-sec} or {stack-manage-app} to cases in {observability}.
